// 8kyu -- A Needle in the Haystack


// Can you find the needle in the haystack?

// Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

// After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

// "found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

// Example(Input --> Output)

// ["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 
// Note: In COBOL, it should return "found the needle at position 6"

function findNeedle(haystack) {
    return `found the needle at position ${haystack.indexOf('needle')}`;
}

//8 kyu -How many stairs will Suzuki climb in 20 years?


// Suzuki is a monk who climbs a large staircase to the monastery as part of a ritual. 
//Some days he climbs more stairs than others depending on the number of students..
// he must train in the morning. He is curious how many stairs might be climbed..
// over the next 20 years and has spent a year marking down his daily progress.

// The sum of all the stairs logged in a year will be used for estimating the number ..
//he might climb in 20.

// 20_year_estimate = one_year_total * 20

// You will receive the following data structure representing the stairs Suzuki logged in a year. 
//You will have all data for the entire year so regardless of how it is ..
//logged the problem should be simple to solve.

// Make sure your solution takes into account all of the nesting within the stairs array.

//7KYU- You're a square!

// A square of squares
// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. 
//And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. 
//Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! 
//If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! 
//That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

// Task
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

// In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer;
// in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

// The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

// Examples
// -1  =>  false
//  0  =>  true
//  3  =>  false
//  4  =>  true
// 25  =>  true
// 26  =>  false

var isSquare = function(n){
