//7kyu -- Breaking chocolate problem

// Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. 
// Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

// For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break,
//  but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

// If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). 
// Input will always be a non-negative integer.


function breakChocolate(n,m) {
    return 0;
  }

//A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. 
//For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, 
 // because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

//Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
